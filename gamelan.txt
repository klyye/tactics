------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Levels with different objectives like Fire Emblem
- Each level is a scene
- Load next level after you finish this one

2. Enemy AI that's fun to play against
- Create a heuristic based on objective
- AI picks the best move when sorting all possible moves by heuristic score

3. Story — written by R. Zhang
- Humans can summon elementals
- Pirate is the protagonist, Granny is the bad guy
- Light Elementals are the bad guys, everyone else is trying to fight them
- Light Elementals brainwash other elementals so the enemy has multiple elements

4. Save/load the game
- gonna do it right now follow the tutorial lmao
- toggled from pause menu

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO
Pause Menu
maybe decouple pause behavior from pause menu?
maybe use events?

Board State
Needed for minimax, save/load
Need a way to transition between board states
One single Scene for gameplay, and different levels are just stored as different starting board states?
Would make level editing in script really easy
Must contain:
    width and height of grid
    2d array of terrain
    all units
    location, hit points, action points of all units
    turn order, objective for AI
